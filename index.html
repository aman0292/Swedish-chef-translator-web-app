            Convert from English to Swedish chef Speak. The Swedish Chef is a Muppet character that appeared on The Muppet Show. The Swedish Chef does not speak any known language, but his nonsense words are so widley interpreted as Swedish-sounding. So try converting and see what our chef says...bork, bork, bork!
